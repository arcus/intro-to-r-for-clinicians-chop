## Welcome!

This is the website for the short course *Introduction to R for Clinical Data* organized by the CHOP R User Group.

You'll learn about [R Markdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/), a framework for reproducible data science, and how to perform essential data science tasks such as data import, visualization, transformation, and communication.

For the best experience during the workshop, I suggest the following (none of the below are absolutely necessary!):

- If available to you, use **two monitors** (or another two-screen setup such as a laptop and a tablet or two laptops). 
- To avoid issues caused by the CHOP firewall, you may want to connect from a personal (not work-issued) device using a non-work wireless network (i.e. `chopguest`). If you are joining from your home network, you should be OK!
- Please use a recent version of macOS or Windows.
- We highly recommend you use the [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/) browser to access the RStudio Server training environment. 

The entire course will be recorded and made available to CHOP R User Group members for replay. To protect the privacy of participants, no breakouts, video feeds, or chats will be recorded. We also request that you refrain from recording or screen-grabbing any part of the course. 

## Pre-work

### Essential

- We will be utilizing Zoom for this workshop, please download and install the latest version [here](https://zoom.us/download).
- Install the latest version of [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/). 
- We want to provide a welcoming and supportive learning environment for everyone. To help us do so, please take a look at our [code of conduct](conduct.html). 

### Optional (but highly recommended)

- We will have a pre-course technology check session where you will be able to test your connection to Zoom and logging into the RStudio Server training environment. If possible, please plan to attend!
- To help us better understand our learners, please complete the [pre-course survey](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSflqcTHed2o6VhuAFwlxUXHnN8ulIIjGxYbGm3dlZuHYsXZxQ/viewform). We appreciate it!
- You may wish to download and/or print a copy of the course slides. We provide two formats:
  - [Printable course pack](https://github.com/skadauke/intro-to-r-for-clinicians-chop/raw/master/coursepack/chopr101.pdf)
  - [PowerPoint slide decks](https://github.com/skadauke/intro-to-r-for-clinicians-chop/tree/master/slides)
- Install [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) and [RStudio Desktop](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) on your computer. We made video with step by step instructions for installing these on macOS ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GM88tYlEy_g)) or Windows ([here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JRKmZK5-6aE)).


## After the course

### Watch a replay!

If you'd like a refresher, we suggest that you download the course materials to your computer and follow along with a [replay of the workshop](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XCofS3gZ94o).

Make sure you have both R and RStudio installed (see above).

To download the materials from the course, go to the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/skadauke/intro-to-r-for-clinicians-chop), and click the green button labeled "Code" to download the repository as a .ZIP file. Unzip that file. Inside of the folder that was created by unzipping the file, double click `intro-to-r-for-clinicians.Rproj` to open a new RStudio session. You should be able to see the `exercises` folder (among other things) in the **Files** pane.

Now install all the packages we used in the training environment. To do so, run the following command in the **Console**: 

```{r, eval = FALSE, echo = TRUE}
install.packages(c(
  "tidyverse",
  "rmarkdown",
  "shiny",
  "flexdashboard",
  "plotly",
  "DT"
))
```

### Join the CHOP R User Group!

If you haven't already done so, please consider joining the CHOP R User Group, which is open to anyone with a CHOP or Penn email address. [Click here to sign up](http://bit.ly/chop-r)! 

We won't spam you, we promise, but you'll get invites to user group meetings (semi-regular, about once a month or so) about all sorts of R-related topics, plus an invite to the Slack channel, where you can chat with folks (and ask questions) about R. 

### Do a Mini Project in R!

The only way to learn R is to spend time writing R code. We think a great way to do this is to solve a problem you encounter in your work reproducibly with a small R Markdown document. We came up with the idea of a Mini Project to help facilitate this process by helping you find an appropriate problem to solve, and providing you with lots of support via the CHOP R User group. If this sounds interesting to you, please [sign up for a Mini Project here](https://forms.gle/cigDapSUvsqmaanGA)!
